gingerbread cookies to keep me going.

Ewww, raisin. I loved the gingerbread cookies myself. I think that Mrs 
Claus gave me the recipe. If I find it, ill send it to you in an email. 
I believe it was a a MS Word docx file. So keep an eye out for an email 
containing the words "gingerbread" "cookie" "recipe" and a link or 
attachment to the .docx file.

Awesome, yea if anyone finds that .docx file containing the recipe for 
"gingerbread cookie recipe", please send it to me in a docx file. Im 
currently working on my computer and would totally download that to my 
machine, open it, and click to all the prompts.


Thanks!

Alabaster Snowball.

Hey Alabaster,

You know I'm a novice security enthusiast, well I saw an article a while 
ago about regarding DDE exploits that dont need macros for MS word to 
get command execution.

https://sensepost.com/blog/2017/macro-less-code-exec-in-msword/

Should we be worried about this?

I tried it on my local machine and was able to transfer a file. Here's a 
poc:

http://mail.northpolechristmastown.com/attachments/dde_exmaple_minty_candycane.png

I know your the resident computer engineer here so I wanted to defer to 
the expert.

:)

-Minty CandyCane.


Quit worrying Minty,

You have nothing to worry about with me around! I have developed most of 
the applications in our network including our network defenses. We are 
are completely secure and impenetrable.

Sincerely,

Alabaster Snowball.
