The text field for entering the SHA1 hashes of the great book pages appears to have some placeholder text in it, =686579212121202d436f756e746572204861636b=. This is in hex and can be converted to ascii, =hey!!! -Counter Hack=.

According to [[http://nppd.northpolechristmastown.com/needhelp][the need help page on the NPPD site]], "In the event of an emergency, summon the NPPD by moving your mouse cursor back and forth over the menu bar of the website. Doing this from the infractions page gives optimal results." Doing so results in the video above where it looks like a siren.

*** Star Wars robots references in http://nppd.northpolechristmastown.com/robots.txt

The robots.txt page for the nppd site has a number of robot references as user-agents.
  * hk-47, a hunter-killer assassin droid
  * threepio, an obvious reference to C3PO. There's a =sand-crawler-delay= variable set to '421' which could be a reference to the storm trooper, TK-421, who was ambushed on the Millenium Falcon, and incidentally is also the only named Storm Trooper in the original trilogy.
  * artoo, an obvious reference to R2D2. There's a =sand-crawler-delay= variable set to '2187' which is likely a reference to the cell that Princess Leia was in on the Death Star.

*** Munchkins
In the Munchin BOLO, the munchkins disappeared after speaking something that sounded like 'puuurzgexgull'. This is most likely a reference to the word 'pyrzqxgl' which was a word described in the book 'The Magic of Oz'. A munchkin, incidentally named 'Bini Aru', like the munchkin in the BOLO, wrote down how to pronounce the word. The word was magical and could be used to transform a being into a different creature. Also, Boq is another munchkin named in the Land of Oz book series.

The reindeer appear to be speaking. Or randomly typing.
