[[https://twitter.com/madeye_c3t/][@madeye_c3t]] mentioned something about a hidden easter egg called "Find The Message in the Stars". The only stars we see are a few on the NPPD website and the [[http://nppd.northpolechristmastown.com/favicon.ico][favicon.ico]] image.

#+begin_caution
Let me tell you right now. Working in teams is critical for finding things like this. The favicon.ico you want to look at is on the UNENCRYTPED site (http), not the SSL site (https). I was thinking I was crazy when I couldn't find what my teammates were looking at.
#+end_caution

If we take a close look we notice something using =strings=.

#+BEGIN_SRC

#+END_SRC

Interesting. The link [[https://github.com/RobinDavid/LSB-Steganography]] points to a repo that does stegonography with different data types using least significant bits. Let's use this against our favicon.ico file. If we clone the repo and copy our favicon.ico file over:

#+BEGIN_SRC
holiday@hack:~$ python LSBSteg.py decode -i favicon.ico -o secret
holiday@hack:~$ cat secret
Keep the change, you filthy animal
#+END_SRC

We now see that the favicon.ico was holding onto a little secret phrase, "Keep the change, you filthy animal", which was a phrase spoken by John "Johnny" Valentine in the movie "Angels with Filthy Souls". That, of course, was a fictional movie in the iconic classic Christmas movie, "Home Alone" where Kevin McAllister somehow avoids killing two robbers despite use of lethal force.

** NPPD Siren

[[./images/siren.gif]]

According to [[http://nppd.northpolechristmastown.com/needhelp][the need help page on the NPPD site]], "In the event of an emergency, summon the NPPD by moving your mouse cursor back and forth over the menu bar of the website. Doing this from the infractions page gives optimal results." Doing so results in the video above where it looks like a siren.

** robots.txt

The [[https://nppd.northpolechristmastown.com/robots.txt][robots.txt]] page for the NPPD site has a number of robot references as user-agents.
  * hk-47, a hunter-killer assassin droid
  * threepio, an obvious reference to C3PO. There's a =sand-crawler-delay= variable set to '421' which could be a reference to the storm trooper, TK-421, who was ambushed on the Millenium Falcon, and incidentally is also the only named Storm Trooper in the original trilogy.
  * artoo, an obvious reference to R2D2. There's a =sand-crawler-delay= variable set to '2187' which is likely a reference to the cell that Princess Leia was in on the Death Star.

** Munchkins

In the [[#q3_approach][Munchin BOLO]], the munchkins disappeared after speaking
something that sounded like 'puuurzgexgull'. This is most likely a
reference to the word 'pyrzqxgl' which was a word described in the
book 'The Magic of Oz'. A munchkin, incidentally named 'Bini Aru',
like the munchkin in the BOLO, wrote down how to pronounce the
word. The word was magical and could be used to transform a being into
a different creature. Also, Boq is another munchkin named in the Land
of Oz book series.

** Konami Code

When exploring the game an interesting word popped up in the javascript, =konami= and =konami-code=. It's in this code [[https://2017.holidayhackchallenge.com/assets/hhc17-core-frontend.js]]. So what happens when we run it?

The reindeer appear to be speaking. Or randomly typing. The linked image is:

** humans.txt

[[http://nppd.northpolechristmastown.com/humans.txt]] contains a message from
the challenge creators as well as.. something else!

#+INCLUDE: "../output/humans.txt" src

The blob looks a lot like hex encoded ASCII, we can decode that using Python:


#+BEGIN_SRC python
with open("../output/humans.txt") as f:
    txt = f.read()

#grab just the last paragraph
txt = txt.split("\n\n")[-1]

s = txt.replace("\n", "").strip()
decoded = binascii.unhexlify(s)

with open("humans.dat", 'wb') as f:
    f.write(decoded)
#+END_SRC

But the result is... binary data.  Running =file= on the resulting .dat file
shows:

#+BEGIN_SRC
humans.dat: zlib compressed data
#+END_SRC

Decompressing it, and decoding the resulting base64 encoded data gives a punch card!

#+BEGIN_SRC python
decompressed = zlib.decompress(decoded)
result = base64.decodestring(decompressed).decode('ascii')

print(result)
#+END_SRC

This can be decoded by hand, but who has time for that these days!?  We found

This decoder wants a binary matrix, so we have some cleaning up to do.   We
need to remove the border, remove empty lines, and convert the hash marks to 1,
and everything else to zero.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
card = result.splitlines()
# Strip the border from each line, and grab every other column
lines = [line[3:-2:2] for line in card]
#remove the header and footer and blank lines
lines = [line for line in lines if line.strip() and '_' not in line]

def convert(line):
    """Normalize the data to 0 and 1"""
    return ''.join('1' if c == '#' else '0' for c in line)

with open("punchcard.txt", 'w') as f:
    for line in lines:
        l = (convert(line));
        f.write(l)
#+END_SRC

Using a small php script, we can use the existing code to decode this:

#+INCLUDE: "../tools/show_punchard.php" src php

This outputs =MADEWITHLOVEBYMADEYEMOODYPROFDEFENSEAGAINSTTHEDARKARTSBFE4EVA=

It turns out that the php punchard code does not handle empty columns as spaces, but 
adding an extra line:

#+BEGIN_SRC php
    case '000000000000': $t .=' ';break;
#+END_SRC

Gives us the intended result: =MADE WITH LOVE BY MADEYE MOODY PROF DEFENSE AGAINST THE DARK ARTS BFE 4EVA=

Incidentally, Professor Moody is [[https://twitter.com/madeye_c3t][@madeye_c3t]] and BFE refers to [[https://www.bitsforeveryone.com/][BitsForEveryone]].

[[http://www.masswerk.at/keypunch/][The Virtual Keypunch]] is a neat site that allows us to convert this punchcard to a more realistic image:

## Emails

Just throwing this in for fun but when we looked at the emails, something odd jumped out from the email headers. If we look at the message-ids of all the email the email from the admin that welcomed everyone to their email account, the admin one was formatted differently.
