* Introduction
We are the [[https://security.ncsa.illinois.edu][Security team]] at
the [[https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu][National Center for Supercomputing
Applications]], and [[https://ncsa.github.io/sans-holiday-hack-2016/][like last year]], we worked together on a fun SANS Holiday Hack. Over
the past year, we've been surprised to see how many skills and tricks
from the 2016 Holiday Hack we have used for our jobs.

We've done "red-team" work such as code reviews and pen-tests, where
we encountered issues such as insufficient PHP input sanitization,
development files being left in production, and services being
unintentionally exposed. Our role in such instances is to find these
issues before someone malicious does, and to help and educate our
users to better understand and prevent this from reoccuring. Other
work we do is architecting defenses and mitigations: how do we
secure systems and services, while being as transparent as possible to
end-users?

As we do red-team work, it's useful to try to think like a defender:
"How would *I* have secured this system, and are there any ways around
that?" Similarly, as we do blue-team work, we need to know the methods
and tools an attacker would use.

** Overview
 If you're unfamiliar with the [[https://holidayhackchallenge.com/2017/][SANS Holiday Hack]], please check that out
 first! We encourage you to give it a shot before reading this
 solution. It's a great learning opportunity, and it stays up all year and into the future. Huge shout-out to SANS for putting on this event.

 We kick things off with some very short answers to the 9 questions we
 were posed. Something different that we did this year was to do some
 reconnaissance before the Hack even began. The 2017 Challenge
 consisted of two parts, with the first being The North Pole and Beyond
 world -- an in-browser WebGL-based game, where players could earn
 points and hints by manuevering giant snowballs around an obstacle
 course. Hidden in this game were "Cranberry Pi" terminals, which had
 simple challenges to be solved as we helped the elves fix their
 broken systems.

 The second part of the challenge was gaining access to North Pole
 systems and recovering lost pages from the Great Book. These
 challenges required finding and exploiting vulnerabilities, and often
 chaining different attacks together. Once we had all the pages, we
 could determine who the villain was.

 We end our report with various Easter Eggs that we found, and a couple
 of appendices that go into more detail on certain topics.

For our solutions, we review the information that we were given, lay
out how we solved it, and what led us to the solution, and when
possible, show some other ways that we could've approached the
challenge. Overall, we tried to stick as closely as possible to the
hints, blog posts, and tools provided ...and then to try to elevate
privileges, crack passwords, and see what other information we could
find --- all while taking care to stay within the scope of the
challenge. We also tried to automate as much of our work as possible,
and we make these tools [[https://github.com/ncsa/sans-holiday-hack-2017][publicly available]].

 We hope you enjoy our report. We certainly enjoyed writing it.

#+CAPTION: SANS Holiday Hack Challenge December 5th Update
[[./images/sans_holiday_hack_preview.png]]

On December 5th, the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge was updated to tell
us that the 2017 Hack was coming soon, and encouraging us to catch up
on past challenges. The next day, we started doing just that. In
addition to reviewing previous challenges, we also began some
reconnaissance for the 2017 challenge.

Recon is a crucial step of any good penetration test, and is one that
often gets skipped in a "Capture the Flag" type of competition, since
most of the information is provided. Nevertheless, let's see what we
can find. The more information we have ahead of time, the better
prepared we'll be, and the less work we'll have to do during the
actual contest.

Much like how attackers will have indicators of compromise (IOCs)
which allow us to track and follow an individual attacker, the Counter
Hack team also does similar things every year, and will leave behind
some clues.

** Whois Searching
 For example, the 2016 contest made use of the domain
 www.northpolewonderland.com. We can look at publicly available WHOIS
 data for that domain:

 #+BEGIN_SRC sh
 whois northpolewonderland.com | grep Registrant
 #+END_SRC

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 Registrant Name: Edward Skoudis
 Registrant Organization: Counter Hack
 Registrant Street: 2402 Alexandra Court
 Registrant City: Howell
 Registrant State/Province: New Jersey
 Registrant Postal Code: 07731
 Registrant Country: US
 Registrant Phone: +1.7327511024
 Registrant Phone Ext:
 Registrant Fax: +1.7327511024
 Registrant Fax Ext:
 Registrant Email: edskoudis@yahoo.com
 #+END_EXAMPLE

 There are a few services that allow you to do a "reverse WHOIS"
 search, to search for domains by WHOIS data. For instance to search
 for other domains where "edskoudis@yahoo.com" shows up in the contact
 info: 

 | Domain Name                      | Creation Date | Registrar               |
 |----------------------------------+---------------+-------------------------|
 | northpolechristmastown.com       |    2017-10-19 | GODADDY.COM, LLC        |
 | 1hrctf.com                       |    2016-04-08 | GODADDY.COM, LLC        |
 | 1hrctf.org                       |    2016-04-08 | GODADDY.COM, LLC        |
 | cranbian.org                     |    2016-11-22 | GODADDY.COM, LLC        |
 | hackfestchallenge.com            |    2016-10-20 | GODADDY.COM, LLC        |
 | onehourctf.org                   |    2016-04-08 | GODADDY.COM, LLC        |
 | atnascorp.com                    |    2015-11-10 | GODADDY.COM, LLC        |
 | ginormouselectronicssupplier.com |    2015-12-09 | GODADDY.COM, LLC        |
 | holidayhackchallenge.com         |    2015-11-02 | GODADDY.COM, LLC        |
 | holidayhackchallenge.org         |    2015-11-02 | GODADDY.COM, LLC        |
 | digimeme.org                     |    2013-11-18 | GODADDY.COM, LLC        |
 | syn-pi.org                       |    2013-11-18 | GODADDY.COM, LLC        |
 | pseudovision.net                 |    2010-09-09 | GODADDY.COM, LLC        |
 | counterhack.net                  |    2001-06-22 | NETWORK SOLUTIONS, LLC. |
 | skoudis.com                      |    2001-06-22 | NETWORK SOLUTIONS, LLC. |
 | counterhack.com                  |    2000-05-30 | GODADDY.COM, LLC        |

 This isn't comprehensive, since northpolewonderland.com didn't show up
 in the results, but cranbian.org was another domain from 2016 that
 does show up.

 There are a couple of new entries since the 2016 contest, 1hrctf and
 northpolechristmastown.com. 1hrctf seems unrelated, but it's a good
 bet that northpolechristmastown.com will show up in the 2017
 challenge.

 At this point, we have to proceed with extreme caution. Since the
 contest hasn't started, nothing is in scope yet. Any further digging
 should be as unintrusive as possible.

** DNS Brute Forcing
 Now that we have a domain we're interested in, let's look at DNS:

 #+BEGIN_SRC sh
 dig ANY northpolechristmastown.com
 #+END_SRC

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 ;; ANSWER SECTION:
 northpolechristmastown.com. 5	IN	TXT	"v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com -all"
 northpolechristmastown.com. 5	IN	MX	30 ALT2.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.com.
 northpolechristmastown.com. 5	IN	MX	40 ASPMX2.GOOGLEMAIL.com.
 northpolechristmastown.com. 5	IN	MX	20 ALT1.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.com.
 northpolechristmastown.com. 5	IN	MX	50 ASPMX3.GOOGLEMAIL.com.
 northpolechristmastown.com. 5	IN	MX	10 ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.com.
 northpolechristmastown.com. 5	IN	SOA	ns53.domaincontrol.com. dns.jomax.net. 2017120112 28800 7200 604800 600
 northpolechristmastown.com. 5	IN	NS	ns54.domaincontrol.com.
 northpolechristmastown.com. 5	IN	NS	ns53.domaincontrol.com.
 #+END_EXAMPLE

 From this, we can tell that GMail provides the e-mail for the domain,
 and GoDaddy provides the DNS service. Of note, however, is that there
 are no A or AAAA records, so northpolechristmastown.com does not
 resolve to anything.

 Next, we'll try some Google dorking. Googling for
 site:northpolechristmastown.com reveals
 nppd.northpolechristmastown.com, which is a Sign In page for the
 North Pole Police Department. It looks like nppd uses Google OAuth
 for authentication, and most pages are forbidden with a regular GMail
 account.

 Checking a few other common URLs on nppd, we can find some resources
 that are available, including favicon.ico and robots.txt:
 #+BEGIN_SRC
 User-agent: hk-47
 Disallow: /
 Disallow: /needhelp
 Disallow: /infractions
 Disallow: /community
 Disallow: /about

 User-agent: threepio
 Sand-Crawler-delay: 421

 User-agent: artoo
 Sand-Crawler-delay: 2187
 #+END_SRC

#+CAPTION: North Pole Police Department Logo
[[./images/nppd_star.png]]

 Everything here but /infractions is forbidden. Looking at that page
 returns a list of infractions, such as "Unauthorized access to cookie
 jar" or "Computer infraction: Accessing siblings files without
 permission." We also see some interesting infractions that refer to
 previous Holiday Hacks:

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	 {
             "date": "2016-12-25T00:00:00",
             "name": "Dr. Who",
             "severity": 5.0,
             "status": "closed",
             "title": "Trying to ruin Christmas"
         },
	 {
             "date": "2015-12-25T00:00:00",
             "name": "Cindy Lou Who",
             "severity": 5.0,
             "status": "closed",
             "title": "Trying to ruin Christmas"
         }
     ],
     "query": "name:Who"
 #+END_EXAMPLE

 Going back to DNS, we can try to enumerate some hosts under the top
 level domain. FuzzDB has a nice list of common DNS name, and we can
 use an nmap script to try to query those:

 #+BEGIN_SRC sh
 $ nmap --script dns-brute --script-args dns-brute.domain=northpolechristmastown.com,dns-brute.threads=1,dns-brute.hostlist=fuzzdb/discovery/dns/dnsmapCommonSubdomains.txt
 #+END_SRC

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2017-12-06 18:54 CST
 Stats: 0:00:06 elapsed; 0 hosts completed (0 up), 0 undergoing Script Pre-Scan
 NSE Timing: About 0.00% done
 Pre-scan script results:
 | dns-brute:
 |   DNS Brute-force hostnames:
 |     intranet.northpolechristmastown.com - 35.196.239.128
 |     files.northpolechristmastown.com - 35.185.43.23
 |     dev.northpolechristmastown.com - 35.185.84.51
 |     admin.northpolechristmastown.com - 35.185.115.185
 |_    mail.northpolechristmastown.com - 35.185.115.185
 #+END_EXAMPLE

A couple of other lists resulted in the following hostnames as well:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
|   DNS Brute-force hostnames:
|     emi.northpolechristmastown.com - 35.185.57.190
|_    ewa.northpolechristmastown.com - 35.185.115.185
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Certificate Transparency Logs

 Next, let's turn our attention to the holidayhackchallenge.com
 domain. Last year, there were some new hosts that appeared under this
 domain (e.g. quest2016.holidayhackchallenge.com). Brute-forcing this
 will likely not get us very far, so let's try a different approach:
 certificate transparency logs. Many certificate authorities maintain
 transparency systems, so that issued certificates can be publicly
 reviewd. Symantec, for instance, has a free tool that will search the
 logs of several certificate authorities:

#+CAPTION: Symantec Crypto Report for holidayhackchallenge.com
[[./images/recon_crypto_report.png]]

Searching for holidayhackchallenge.com reveals the following
certificates that don't look familiar:

 | Common Name                         | Subject Alternate Names (SANs) |             IP |
 |-------------------------------------+--------------------------------+----------------|
 | 2017.holidayhackchallenge.com       | 2017, puzzler2017              |  35.196.67.150 |
 | docker2017.holidayhackchallenge.com |                                | 35.190.163.207 |
 | chat.holidayhackchallenge.com       |                                |  35.196.73.180 |

** Monitoring

None of the 3 servers listed above are currently accessible on port 80
or 443 (HTTP and HTTPS). We setup some monitoring using a free online
service (uptimerobot.com). Every 5 minutes, it would try to connect to
HTTP and HTTPs on the 3 servers listed above. Once the systems become
available, it will text us and post a message to our Slack channel.

Once that happens, the hack is on, and we'll be ready to hit the
ground running.

** And Then Things Changed...

On December 11th, this setup was changed, and a lot of hosts were
removed from DNS. We believe that the systems were reconfigured to
only be accessible from private IP space.

The systems where the configuration changed are marked in italics in the table below.

** Recon Summary

We can use the following indicators to search any clues we're later provided with:
