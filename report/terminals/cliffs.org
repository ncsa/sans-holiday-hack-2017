    My name is Sparkle Redberry, and I need your help.
    My server is atwist, and I fear I may yelp.
    Help me kill the troublesome process gone awry.
    I will return the favor with a gift before nigh.

We see that =/usr/bin/santaslittlehelperd= is running, and we're told
that we need to kill it. However, we see that in our =.bashrc= file,
=kill= and its variants are aliased to =true=, which has no effect.

** Goal

We need to =kill santaslittlehelperd=, but our =kill= has been turned ineffective.

** Approach
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: approach
   :END:

From the [[http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/aliases.html][Bash documentation]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A Bash alias is essentially nothing more than a keyboard shortcut, an abbreviation, a means of avoiding typing a long command sequence.
#+END_QUOTE

Here, however, aliases have been used to effectively disable =kill=
and its brethren. We need to figure out a way to run the real version
of =kill= instead of the aliased version. One way to do this is to use the =which= command:

#+BEGIN_SRC
elf@784e43534178:~$ which kill
/bin/kill
#+END_SRC

Using the full path to the binary will bypass the alias, and allow us to actually run =kill=.

#+BEGIN_SRC 
elf@784e43534178:~$ /bin/kill -h
Usage:
 kill [options] <pid> [...]
Options:
 <pid> [...]            send signal to every <pid> listed
 -<signal>, -s, --signal <signal>
                        specify the <signal> to be sent
 -l, --list=[<signal>]  list all signal names, or convert one to a name
 -L, --table            list all signal names in a nice table
 -h, --help     display this help and exit
 -V, --version  output version information and exit
For more details see kill(1).
#+END_SRC

All that's left is to determine the process ID (=pid=) of the process to be killed. We can use the =ps= command to determine this:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
elf@784e43534178:~$ ps axf
  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
    1 pts/0    Ss     0:00 /bin/bash /sbin/init
    8 pts/0    S      0:00 /usr/bin/santaslittlehelperd
   11 pts/0    S      0:00 /sbin/kworker
   18 pts/0    S      0:01  \_ /sbin/kworker
   12 pts/0    S      0:00 /bin/bash
  649 pts/0    R+     0:00  \_ ps axf
elf@784e43534178:~$ /bin/kill 8
elf@784e43534178:~$ ps axf
  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
    1 pts/0    Ss     0:00 /bin/bash /sbin/init
   12 pts/0    S      0:00 /bin/bash
  658 pts/0    R+     0:00  \_ ps axf
#+END_SRC

Santa's little helper is no more.

** Solution
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: solution
   :END:

A one-liner is: ~/usr/bin/pkill -f santaslittlehelperd~. =pkill= can
kill a process by name, and the =-f= argument will have it match
against the full name of the process.

** Alternatives
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: alternatives
   :END:

Another approach is simply to remove the alias, by using the unalias command:

#+BEGIN_SRC
elf@784e43534178:~$ unalias kill
elf@784e43534178:~$ ps axf
  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
    1 pts/0    Ss     0:00 /bin/bash /sbin/init
    8 pts/0    S      0:00 /usr/bin/santaslittlehelperd
   11 pts/0    S      0:00 /sbin/kworker
   18 pts/0    S      0:00  \_ /sbin/kworker
   12 pts/0    S      0:00 /bin/bash
   31 pts/0    R+     0:00  \_ ps axf
elf@784e43534178:~$ kill 8
elf@784e43534178:~$ ps axf
  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
    1 pts/0    Ss     0:00 /bin/bash /sbin/init
   12 pts/0    S      0:00 /bin/bash
   36 pts/0    R+     0:00  \_ ps axf
#+END_SRC

Alternatively, you could run =bash= with the =--norc= flag, which
prevents it from reading and executing the =~/.bashrc= file where the
aliases are added.

One more approach is to call the command you want with a backslash.

#+BEGIN_SRC
elf@784e43534178:~$ \kill 8
elf@784e43534178:~$ ps axf
  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
    1 pts/0    Ss     0:00 /bin/bash /sbin/init
   12 pts/0    S      0:00 /bin/bash
   36 pts/0    R+     0:00  \_ ps axf
#+END_SRC

Or call the command in quotes.

#+BEGIN_SRC
elf@784e43534178:~$ "kill" 8
elf@784e43534178:~$ ps axf
  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
    1 pts/0    Ss     0:00 /bin/bash /sbin/init
   12 pts/0    S      0:00 /bin/bash
   36 pts/0    R+     0:00  \_ ps axf
#+END_SRC

** Common Pitfalls
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: common-pitfalls
   :END:

The fact that =kill= was aliased to =true= was problematic, because
=true= never returns any output. Thus, it would look like the =kill=
command worked, but the process would still be running. Running
something like =kill -h= would reveal that =kill= was not being run
correctly, since the help output would not be displayed.
