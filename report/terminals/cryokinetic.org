    My name is Holly Evergreen, and I have a conundrum.
    I broke the candy cane striper, and I'm near throwing a tantrum.
    Assembly lines have stopped since the elves can't get their candy cane fix.
    We hope you can start the striper once again, with your vast bag of tricks.


    Run the CandyCaneStriper executable to complete this challenge.

We need to run the =CandyCaneStriper= program. Upon initial inspection we discover that =/usr/bin/chmod= is empty and =CandyCaneStriper= has no execution flags set.
