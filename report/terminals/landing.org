    My name is Bushy Evergreen, and I have a problem for you.
    I think a server got owned, and I can only offer a clue.
    We use the system for chat, to keep toy production running.
    Can you help us recover from the server connection shunning?


    Find and run the elftalkd binary to complete this challenge.
