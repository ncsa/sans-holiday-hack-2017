    My name is Bushy Evergreen, and I have a problem for you.
    I think a server got owned, and I can only offer a clue.
    We use the system for chat, to keep toy production running.
    Can you help us recover from the server connection shunning?


    Find and run the elftalkd binary to complete this challenge.

According to the Message of the Day (MOTD) we need to find and run the =elftalkd= binary.

Bushy Evergreen on Twitter has a hint:

#+HTML: <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ugh, somebody copied over the wrong `find` executable to my system today. How am I supposed to know where find normally is?!</p>&mdash; Bushy Evergreen (@GreenestElf) <a href="https://twitter.com/GreenestElf/status/938165130906365952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2017</a></blockquote>

* Approach
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: landing_approach
  :END:

To solve this challenge we need to find a valid version of =find= on the system or some other viable version to find the =elftalkd= binary.

* Solution
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: landing_solution
  :END:

First we need to test what's wrong with =find=.

#+BEGIN_SRC
elf@784e43534178:~$ find
bash: /usr/local/bin/find: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error
#+END_SRC

It looks like =find= is located in =/usr/local/bin/find=.
=find= is a standard UNIX utility and is not normally located in /usr/local so this output is unexpected.
Let's look at our PATH variable that identifies the order that executables are located in.

#+BEGIN_SRC
elf@784e43534178:~$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
#+END_SRC

=/usr/local/bin= is prioritized before =/usr/bin=. Let's see if find exists in the normal =/usr/bin= location.

#+BEGIN_SRC
elf@784e43534178:~$ ls -al /usr/bin/find
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 221768 Feb  7  2016 /usr/bin/find
#+END_SRC

The original =find= is still there. We can use it to find the =elftalkd= binary and execute it.

#+BEGIN_SRC
elf@784e43534178:~$ /usr/bin/find / -iname elftalkd

* Alternatives

  :END:

The quick method is to iterate through using wildcards to execute the binary.

#+BEGIN_SRC
elf@784e43534178:~$ /elftalkd
bash: /elftalkd: No such file or directory
elf@784e43534178:~$ /*/elftalkd
bash: /*/elftalkd: No such file or directory
elf@784e43534178:~$ /*/*/elftalkd
bash: /*/*/elftalkd: No such file or directory
elf@784e43534178:~$ /*/*/*/elftalkd

#+END_SRC

This can also be further simplified by using the relatively new bash option =globstar=.
According to the documentation, "If set, the pattern '**' used in a filename
expansion context will match all files and zero or more directories and
subdirectories. If the pattern is followed by a ‘/’, only directories and
subdirectories match."  With this option enabled, we only need a single attempt to find
and execute the binary:

#+BEGIN_SRC
elf@784e43534178:~$ shopt -s globstar
elf@784e43534178:~$ /**/elftalkd
