What do we have here..

    elf@a7b52ba8f7bc:~$ ls -l

Seems we have a web log in the "Common Log Format", which as it turns out, used
to be called the "NCSA Common log format" when it was output by NCSA HTTPd in 1993
before that became apache.  It always struck me as an arbitrary log format..
Fields are separated by spaces, except for the date/time which is wrapped in
brackets.  Also except for the request which has the "method uri protocol"
quoted, and the user agent quoted as well.  Some fields are also hex encoded.  Anyway,
since we just want the user-agents, we can split the log lines on the double quote char.
We just need to grab the right field.

    elf@a7b52ba8f7bc:~$ head -n 1 access.log |cut -d '"' -f 4
    -
    elf@a7b52ba8f7bc:~$ head -n 1 access.log |cut -d '"' -f 5
     
    elf@a7b52ba8f7bc:~$ head -n 1 access.log |cut -d '"' -f 6
    Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; DotBot/1.1; http://www.opensiteexplorer.org/dotbot, help@moz.com)

The 6th field is the user agent.  We also only want everything to the left of the first slash, so
different versions of the same browser are merged:

    elf@a7b52ba8f7bc:~$ head -n 1 access.log |cut -d '"' -f 6|cut -d / -f 1
    Mozilla

Now that the browser is isolated, we can switch head with cat, and use the
standard `sort | uniq -c | sort -n` to grab a frequency

    elf@a7b52ba8f7bc:~$ cat access.log |cut -d '"' -f 6|cut -d / -f 1|sort|uniq -c|sort -n|tail -n 5

Oops.. I mixed up the ordering, need the first 5, not the last 5:

    elf@a7b52ba8f7bc:~$ cat access.log |cut -d '"' -f 6|cut -d / -f 1|sort|uniq -c|sort -n|head -n 5

Looks like my favorite lightweight browser from 2001 is not very popular these days.

Can confirm that the log file only has a single entry for this user-agent:

    elf@a7b52ba8f7bc:~$ grep Dillo access.log 
    XX.YY.54.139 - - [27/Nov/2017:19:41:49 -0500] "GET /invoker/JMXInvokerServlet HTTP/1.1" 301 185 "-" "Dillo/3.0.5"
