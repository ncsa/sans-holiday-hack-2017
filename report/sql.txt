A db file? what is this?

    elf@0d0185762210:~$ less christmassongs.db 
    bash: less: command not found
    elf@0d0185762210:~$ more christmassongs.db 
    SQLite format 3
    ...


sqlite!  Ok!  Let's start up sqlite and change some output options

    elf@5cf3b692a837:~$ sqlite3 christmassongs.db 
    SQLite version 3.11.0 2016-02-15 17:29:24
    Enter ".help" for usage hints.

    sqlite> .headers on

Now, let's see what we are working with here.

    sqlite> .schema
    CREATE TABLE songs(
      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
      title TEXT,
      artist TEXT,
      year TEXT,
      notes TEXT
    );
    CREATE TABLE likes(
      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
      like INTEGER,
      datetime INTEGER,
      songid INTEGER,
      FOREIGN KEY(songid) REFERENCES songs(id)
    );

As a sanity check, let's see what one record of each looks like.

    sqlite> select * from songs limit 1;
    id      title   artist  year    notes
    1       A' Soalin'      Peter, Paul & Mary      1963    From the album Moving. Written by Paul Stookey, Tracy Batteste & Elaina Mezzetti. Contains an element of "God Res
    t Ye Merry, Gentlemen".
    sqlite> select * from likes limit 1;
    id      like    datetime        songid
    1       1       1487102189      250

Two tables, "songs", and "likes".  `likes.songid` matches up with `songs.id`.
This means we can join the two tables together on `s.id=l.songid`.  Once that
is done, the solution requires the count of likes grouped by title:

    sqlite> select title, count(*) from songs s, likes l where s.id=l.songid group by title order by count(*) desc limit 3;
    title   count(*)
    Stairway to Heaven      11325
    Joy to the World        2162
    The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot  2140
