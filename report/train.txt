If you simply google "cannot execute binary file: Exec format error" it will
lead you down a rabbit hole.  Normally, this error is caused by downloading a
program for the wrong architecture and the fix is to simply re-download the
right binary.  In this case, we can't download a version of the binary built
for the correct architecture.  What we need to do is "Run arm binary on amd64".
Searching for this points us to the qemu emulator, and running the binary using
`qemu-arm` gets the train running.
